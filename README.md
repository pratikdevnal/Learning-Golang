# 🐹 Learn Go - My Golang Journey

Welcome to my personal Golang learning repository.  
This repo documents my step-by-step journey in mastering Go, from fundamentals to advanced concepts including concurrency, API development, and backend engineering.

## 🚀 Learning Goals
- Understand Go syntax, packages, and standard library
- Master goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns
- Work with files, JSON, and databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Build RESTful APIs using net/http and Gin
- Explore Go modules, testing, and error handling
- Learn practical DevOps integration with Go (Docker, CI/CD)
